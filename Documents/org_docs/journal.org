     - Went to Vision Express to replace my new glasses. I'm not
       getting on with them.
     - Hinges too stiff and now starting to creak.
     - Lenses too big and heavy. It's like looking through a shop
       window.
     - Lenses steam up too often. Need to to be cleaned 3 times on a
       cold morning.

       which could be the cause of my hearing loss. The tinnitus was

       was over I could hardly see. The visual fields test was failed

       does not seem to be any major difficulties. In fact I'm really
       pleased with them, the optician, a student, got the
       prescription spot on. Varifocals have come on so much since I
       bought my last pair. I don't even have trouble on steps or
       stairs. The previous ones were a nightmare. Only 1 problem, the
       bridge of my nose gets quite sore after wearing them for a long
       period of time. Will take them back to Specsavers to see if
       they can make some kind of adjustment. Most probably I will
       have to get used to them :-()

**** - Ear wax removal
Proved to be very difficult as the wax had been impacted by hearing
aids. Nurse gave me some recommendations:
    1. Periodically use olive oil to remove/reduce wax.
    2. Tilt head, lie on bed and for 10 minutes.
    3. Massage ear lobe to help oil mix with wax.
    4. Do not use cotton wool in ears as this will absorb the oil.
    5. Use cotton wool to wipe ears to remove excess oil only.

Tried a 24 hour fast for the first time. Wasn't too bad, just had to
persevere with waves of hunger. Coffee and salt were a great
help. Felt weak and a little dizzy when out walking. Went for a pretty

This time tried a 42 hour fast as the 24 hour one turned out not too
bad. Was OK up to 24 hours then the hunger really kicked in. Got over
it though and by bedtime things were much easier. Also went for a long
walk and the weakness and dizziness were far less than the first
time.Hopefully the hunger will get easier the more I fast.

**** Eye test at Visual Express.
Eyes have got worse so need new glasses. Also informed I have an
infection of my eyelashes and will have to be treated twice a day for
the next fortnight. Will thrn go back to Visual Express for an
assessment to see how the treatment is getting on.  Also my retina is
getting worse. Photographed the back of my eyes and if bad enough will
be referred to the hospital.

*** 21st
Visual Express rang to say my assessmnt could not be done om Monday,
so rearranged for the same day as the retest on the 7th Feb.

** February
*** 7th
    Went for re-assessment at Visual Express. Little sign of eyelash
virus to continue every other day for 2 weeks and then one or twice a
week from then on.
    Also photographed the retinas and optician will contact Dr
Griffiths for referal to Hospital. If I don't hear anything within 10
days contact Dr. Griffiths or Macular Dept at Quenns Medical.
    As for my glasses they will replace my lenses. If I need treatment
from hospital they will replace the lenses as long as treatment is
within 100 days. Should get new glasses within 1 to 2 weeks.
*** 13th
Contacted by Kingmill hospital to say that I had been referred there
