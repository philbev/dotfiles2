   - New stuff :-)

* Printing
** HP printer not showing in LibreOffice and Okular

   This could also occur in other applications as well.
   Solution:
   1. As root run 'hp-setup'.
   2. In KDE 'System Settings' set the printer as default.

* Bash
** Command line corrupted

   Sometimes following a command the command-line would still display the previous command. This had no effect
   on the the current command but could be very off-putting.

*** Solution

     Enter the following command into ~/.bashrc
     shopt -s checkwinsize

** True colour in terminal emulators

   printf "\x1b[${bg};2;${red};${green};${blue}m\n"
   where bg = 38
   red green and blue values in the range 0 to 255
   E.g.
        print "\x1b[38;2;255;0;0m\n" would print in red

** List open files

   The 'lsof' command is very useful for listing files that are open
   by what processes. Examples:
        * lsof -i                  # lists all internet processes on all ports.
        * lsof -i :80              # lists all internet processes on port 80.

* Arch Linux Tips
** Windows NTFS partition

   To mount an NTFS partition with read-write permissions ntfs-3g package needs to be installed:
       # pacman -s ntfs-3g
   Then to mount:
       # mount -t ntfs-3g <device> <mountpoint>

* Manjaro Tips
** Installation

   Choose 'no-free' on installation as this will use Nvidia proprietary drivers instead of Nouveau.

** Comic strip

   Not on Manjaro install.
       sudo pacman -S kross
   should do the trick.

* Chromium (Enabling cast to TV)

  To enable casting on chromium web browser enter the the URL below into chromium:
      chrome://flags/#load-media-router-component-extension
  then change value to 'enable'

* Chromium (Make default browser)

  On new installation of Chromium along with Google-chrome will always
  complain about not being the default browser. To cure this take the
  2 following actions:-
    1. Open 'System Settings' and in the 'Personisation' section, select
	'Applications/Web Browser' and ensure the correct browser is
	selected.
    2. On opening Chromium or Google-chrome, if the 'Set as Default'
	button appears, do not click on it. Click on the 'X' (close)
	icon at the right hand side.
